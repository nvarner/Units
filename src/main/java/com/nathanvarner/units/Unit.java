     *                            unit, pass null. Otherwise, some unit must be chosen as the base unit. It is recommended to chose
     *                            the most universal unit. For example, a rotation is a good example of a base unit for rotation.
     *                            In the case that there is no "universal" unit, best practice would be to use the metric base
     *                            unit. For example, a good base unit for temperature is Celsius. Depending on the exact
     *                            application, it may make more sense to use imperial or SI base units instead.
     * @param xBaseUnits          This is some number of baseUnits. This could be any number, but it is recommended to choose a
     *                            number that works well with xUnitsPerXBaseUnits. For example, if the base unit is a meter and
     *                            this unit is a decimeter, xBaseUnits could be 1 and xUnitsPerXBaseUnits could be 10 because
     *                            there are 10 decimeters to 1 meter.
     * @param xUnitsPerXBaseUnits This is the number of this unit that equals xBaseUnits base units. For example, if the
     *                            base unit is a meter and this unit is a decimeter, xBaseUnits could be 1 and
     *                            xUnitsPerXBaseUnits could be 10 because there are 10 decimeters to 1 meter.
     * @param unitAbbr            This is the abbreviation for the unit. For example, the abbreviation for meters is "m", and the
     *                            abbreviation for seconds is "s".
